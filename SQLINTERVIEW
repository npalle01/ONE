Below is a detailed, in-depth guide to the BRM (Business Rules Management) Tool, covering its architecture, data model, user interface (UI), workflows, and advanced features. This guide presumes you have:
	1.	Deployed the database schema (DDL) provided earlier or a similar schema.
	2.	Built and run the “8-part” integrated application code, typically in Python + PyQt5.

The guide is divided into logical sections to help you understand how to administer, configure, develop, and use this tool effectively.

1. What Is the BRM Tool?

The BRM (Business Rules Management) Tool is an end-to-end system for creating, managing, executing, and monitoring business rules across multiple databases or systems. It provides:
	•	A GUI (Graphical User Interface) built with PyQt5 for easy rule authoring, versioning, approvals, scheduling, and lineage tracking.
	•	A database schema with tables that store rules, decisions, conflicts, audits, schedules, approvals, and more.
	•	Advanced features such as multi-step approvals, complex lineage visualization, rule chaining, BFS-based (Breadth-First Search) execution, decision table management, data validation, user and group management, concurrency control (rule locking), and performance metrics.

This solution addresses the complexities of large-scale business rules management by offering centralized governance, advanced metadata (e.g., rule-to-table dependencies), and enterprise-level features like scheduling, critical rule enforcement, usage metrics, and version rollbacks.

2. Architecture Overview
	1.	Client Application
	•	Written in Python (with PyQt5) for the GUI.
	•	Provides multiple tabs and dialogs to manage different functions: Approvals, Scheduling, Metadata lineage, etc.
	•	Encapsulates BFS logic for rule execution, multi-step approvals, performance logging, and advanced searching.
	2.	Database
	•	All rules, dependencies, logs, approvals, table references, snapshots, etc. are stored in the SQL Server database.
	•	The schema includes over two dozen tables, such as BRM_RULES, BRM_RULE_APPROVALS, RULE_CONFLICTS, DATA_VALIDATIONS, and more.
	•	No foreign keys are declared by default (per user request), though indexes and constraints can be added in production for performance/validation.
	3.	Execution Engine
	•	When a rule executes, the tool performs a BFS (or user-chosen simulation) to determine the order, handle conflicts, skip child rules if a critical rule fails, and record logs.
	•	The advanced parser uses sqlparse to extract table dependencies or columns. This metadata is displayed in the UI for lineage.
	4.	Security & Permissions
	•	Basic user authentication: a LoginDialog checks credentials in the USERS table.
	•	Group-based permissions: GROUP_PERMISSIONS indicates which tables a group can read or write. When creating or updating a rule, the system checks if the user has permission to reference the required database/tables (or else it denies the operation).
	•	Rule locking is enforced to prevent conflicting edits: once locked, an admin or the user can forcibly unlock or auto-unlock after an idle timeout.
	5.	Lineage Visualization
	•	Shows rule → child rule relationships, critical rule links, table references, data validations, composite rules, etc.
	•	Color-coded nodes (active/inactive, global, critical) with minimalistic shapes (rectangles for one type of rule, ellipses for another), plus a dynamic search bar to highlight specific rules/tables.

3. Core Database Entities

Below are the primary tables of interest:
	1.	USERS
	•	Stores username/password and the group to which the user belongs (e.g., BG1, Admin, etc.).
	2.	BUSINESS_GROUPS & BRM_RULE_GROUPS
	•	Represent the named business groups and specialized “rule groups” to logically separate rule ownership.
	3.	BRM_RULES
	•	Central table for all rules (SQL statements, whether they are global or critical, metadata like version, lifecycle state, etc.).
	4.	RULE_CONFLICTS & BRM_GLOBAL_CRITICAL_LINKS
	•	Describe relationships between rules where some are in conflict or globally critical.
	5.	BRM_RULE_APPROVALS
	•	Manages multi-step approval sequences. Each rule can have multiple stages (BG1, BG2, BG3, FINAL, etc.).
	6.	RULE_SCHEDULES
	•	Stores when each rule is scheduled for execution, with statuses like “Scheduled,” “Executed,” “Failed,” etc.
	7.	RULE_EXECUTION_LOGS
	•	Logs each BFS or single-rule run, storing pass/fail, record counts, performance time, etc.
	8.	DATA_VALIDATIONS
	•	Keeps data validations at a table/column level (e.g., NOT NULL, Ranges). The system can combine these with rules to ensure data cleanliness.
	9.	DECISION_TABLES
	•	Holds definitions for rule-based decision tables for non-SQL-based logic.
	10.	COMPOSITE_RULES
	•	Groups multiple rules via a logic expression like “Rule5==PASS AND Rule10==PASS.”
	11.	BRM_CUSTOM_RULE_GROUPS / MEMBERS
	•	Let the user define custom, cross-business rule groupings for simulations or BFS runs that differ from the standard parent-child relationships.
	12.	BRM_AUDIT_LOG
	•	Tracks all insert/update/delete with old/new data, plus any admin actions like link/unlink or global scope changes.

4. Key User Interface Components

4.1 Login Dialog
	•	LoginDialog prompts the user for username/password.
	•	On success, stores user_id, user_group in memory for subsequent permission checks.

4.2 Main Window (BRMTool)
	•	Top-level container with a menu bar and multiple QTabWidget tabs.
	•	File menu includes “Sync Metadata,” “View Metrics,” “Schedule,” “Simulate Rule Chain,” etc.
	•	Tools menu includes “View Audit Logs,” “Search Rules,” and “Version History.”

4.3 Rule Dashboard Tab
	•	Displays a paginated list of rules with filters for name/SQL snippet and status (ACTIVE/INACTIVE).
	•	Allows selection of one or more rules for advanced actions:
	•	Add Rule / Update Rule
	•	Deactivate / Delete
	•	BFS ETL run or single-rule simulation

4.4 Multi-step Approvals Tab
	•	Shows the pending approvals for the logged-in user.
	•	Only shows the user items at the current minimal stage, so higher-stage or later approvals remain hidden.
	•	Approve or Reject transitions the rule’s approval status, with updated lifecycle states.

4.5 Global/Critical Admin Tab
	•	Admin-only tab used for marking rules global or critical, specifying the critical scope (GROUP, CLUSTER, GLOBAL) and linking child rules to global-critical parents.
	•	Also lists the “Global/Critical” rules in a separate grid.

4.6 Hierarchy Tab
	•	A tree view of business groups → rules, supporting drag-and-drop re-parenting.
	•	On drop, the system updates the DB to set PARENT_RULE_ID or GROUP_ID.

4.7 Lineage Visualization Tab
	•	A QGraphicsView scene showing each rule as a shape (rect or ellipse) or each DB table as a small ellipse.
	•	Color-coded for status (active/inactive), global, critical, etc.
	•	The user can search for table names, column references, or rule names, which dims everything else and highlights the matched node(s).
	•	The user can click a node to see the rule’s SQL or additional logic in a tooltip or popup.
	•	A “brain map” style layout is used, with minimalistic shapes and color-coded edges showing data flow (read/write) or rule dependencies (red edges for critical, blue edges for read dependencies, etc.).

4.8 Scheduling Tab
	•	Lists upcoming or past schedules from the RULE_SCHEDULES table.
	•	The user can create, update, or delete schedules, specifying date/time.
	•	A background timer in the main window periodically checks for due schedules and executes them if the time has passed.

4.9 Control Tables Tab
	•	Allows the user to pick a table name (like BRM_RULES, USERS, etc.) from a combo box and see up to 1000 rows.
	•	Useful for quick admin tasks or verifying entries.

4.10 Metrics Dashboard Tab
	•	A bar chart (using pyqtgraph) that shows counts of rules by status (ACTIVE, INACTIVE, etc.).
	•	Can be extended to show additional metrics, e.g., BFS success rates, average performance times, or usage stats.

4.11 Custom Rule Groups Tab
	•	Manages user-defined groupings of rules distinct from the standard parent/child structure.
	•	You can create backups of these custom groups, restore them to a previous membership set, etc.

4.12 Alerts & Dashboards Tab
	•	Summarizes any approvals older than X days, upcoming schedules in the next 24 hours, or other “alert” conditions.

4.13 Group & User Management Tabs
	•	Group Management Tab for admin to create or rename business groups, add or remove users from groups, set group permissions, define group approvers, etc.
	•	User Management Tab for admin to add new user accounts, remove them, or change passwords.

4.14 Advanced Feature Tabs
	•	DecisionTablesTab: add, delete, or run stubs of decision tables.
	•	ConflictPriorityManagerTab: manage conflicting rules with integer priorities.
	•	CompositeRulesTab: define a composite rule, referencing multiple underlying rules (like “Rule10==PASS AND Rule20==PASS”).
	•	SnapshotManagerTab: create JSON snapshots of BRM_RULES for rollback or archival.
	•	TagsManagerTab: add textual tags to rules.
	•	DataValidationTab: manage validations that can be integrated with rules.
	•	WhatIfTestTab: optionally upload CSV, run a BFS or single-rule test scenario, see pass/fail results without changing real data (the code uses a transaction + rollback).

5. Lifecycle and Workflows
	1.	Add a New Rule
	•	A user (in the appropriate group with table-level permission) opens “Add Rule” from the dashboard.
	•	Enters name, SQL, effective dates, etc.
	•	The system checks if they have permission to reference each table the rule’s SQL touches. If not, it rejects the attempt.
	•	On success, the rule is stored in BRM_RULES with LIFECYCLE_STATE = 'DRAFT' or 'UNDER_APPROVAL' and APPROVAL_STATUS='APPROVAL_IN_PROGRESS'.
	2.	Multi-step Approvals
	•	The system auto-creates records in BRM_RULE_APPROVALS, possibly for BG1, BG2, BG3, and a final step.
	•	Each group’s designated approvers appear in the tab if the approval stage is currently “lowest pending.”
	•	Approving or rejecting updates the rule’s statuses accordingly. Once all are approved, it becomes 'ACTIVE'.
	3.	Execution
	•	BFS approach: from root rules or from a custom group.
	•	If a critical or global rule fails, the BFS may skip child or linked rules.
	•	Logs are recorded in RULE_EXECUTION_LOGS, capturing pass/fail, row counts, execution time in ms, etc.
	•	If scheduled, the system picks up the due schedule, runs the BFS or single rule, and updates the schedule’s status.
	4.	Lineage
	•	The advanced SQL parser extracts table references from the rule’s SQL.
	•	The UI draws the graph, with edges from rule → table or rule → child rule.
	•	The user can highlight a node or search for “Orders” to find all references.
	•	Composite and conflict rules also appear, letting you see if multiple or conflicting dependencies exist.
	5.	Locking & Editing
	•	When a user tries to edit a rule, the tool checks if it’s locked in BRM_RULE_LOCKS.
	•	If locked by someone else, the UI denies the edit or requires an admin override (“Force Unlock”).
	•	If the user is idle or logs out, the lock can auto-expire after 30 minutes.
	6.	Versioning & Rollback
	•	Each update is appended to the BRM_AUDIT_LOG with old/new JSON data.
	•	The “Version History” UI shows a chronological list. The user can select an old version to rollback to.
	•	The system sets the rule back to that old state, re-parses dependencies, and sets STATUS='INACTIVE' + APPROVAL_STATUS='APPROVAL_IN_PROGRESS'.

6. Performance & Usage Metrics
	1.	RULE_EXECUTION_LOGS
	•	For each BFS run or single rule run, the tool records:
	•	PASS_FLAG (did we interpret the rule as success or fail?),
	•	MESSAGE (any text from the SQL result),
	•	RECORD_COUNT (# of rows returned),
	•	EXECUTION_TIME_MS (for performance trend analysis).
	2.	MetricsDashboardTab
	•	By default, it shows a bar chart of rule statuses.
	•	You can extend it to show average BFS times, # of failed runs by group, or any other aggregated performance stats.
	3.	AlertsAndDashboardsTab
	•	Surfaces “stale approvals” and “upcoming schedules.”
	•	Could also track “lowest performing rule” or “highest fail count” with additional queries.

7. Security & Enforcement
	1.	Permission Checks
	•	On “Add/Update Rule,” the system analyzes the rule’s SQL to see which DB tables are referenced.
	•	Then it checks GROUP_PERMISSIONS for the user’s group. If the needed table references are missing, the operation is disallowed.
	•	This ensures unauthorized groups cannot create or alter rules referencing restricted tables.
	2.	Locking
	•	BRM_RULE_LOCKS stores which rule is locked, by whom, and at what time.
	•	The GUI disallows concurrent edits.
	•	Admin can forcibly unlock.
	3.	Global/Critical
	•	If IS_GLOBAL=1, only admin can alter or delete that rule.
	•	If CRITICAL_RULE=1 and the scope is “GLOBAL,” the BFS logic will skip all dependent rules if this fails or is not approved, ensuring a “fail fast” approach.

8. Typical User Roles & Flows
	1.	Admin
	•	Full access to user/group management, global/critical admin, forced unlocks, complete line-of-business oversight.
	•	Typically part of the “Admin” group or “BG1” if designated as super-user.
	2.	Business Group Approver
	•	Sees only the rules that need their approval at the current stage.
	•	May have specific table permissions to create or update rules in their domain.
	3.	Regular User
	•	Can log in, see rules belonging to their group, create new rules if they have permission, run BFS simulations on custom groups, etc.
	•	Possibly restricted from seeing other business groups or from marking rules as global or critical.

9. Example End-to-End Workflow
	1.	Login with username/password.
	2.	Create a new rule named “CheckCreditLimit” with an SQL referencing dbo.CreditData.
	•	The system verifies the user’s group has dbo.CreditData in GROUP_PERMISSIONS.
	•	The rule is inserted with APPROVAL_STATUS='APPROVAL_IN_PROGRESS'.
	3.	Approvals are auto-created for BG1 → BG2 → FINAL.
	4.	BG1 Approver sees the item in the Approvals tab. They approve.
	•	The system checks if there’s a BG2 stage. If yes, the rule stays “INACTIVE” until BG2 acts.
	5.	BG2 Approver logs in, sees it as the minimal stage to act on. Approves. Next is “FINAL.”
	6.	Final Approver (admin) sees it, approves. Now the rule is “ACTIVE.”
	7.	Schedule the rule for daily 03:00 AM runs. Once it’s time, BFS is triggered (if it’s a root) or the single rule is executed.
	8.	Execution logs appear in RULE_EXECUTION_LOGS, the user can see pass/fail. Performance times are graphed in metrics dashboards.
	9.	Lineage can be viewed to see how “CheckCreditLimit” references dbo.CreditData, whether it’s critical, or if it’s part of a composite.
	10.	Versioning: If a user updates the rule’s SQL, the old version is stored in BRM_AUDIT_LOG and can be reverted.

10. Conclusion

The BRM Tool is a comprehensive environment for:
	•	Managing rules: versioning, BFS execution, multi-step approvals, scheduling, concurrency locking, group-based security.
	•	Metadata: advanced lineage, table references, composite logic, conflict priorities.
	•	Enhanced usage & performance: scheduling, usage logs, bar charts for statuses, performance time logging, data validations.
	•	Scalability: the BFS logic and line-of-business group separation enable large organizations to manage hundreds or thousands of rules with minimal collisions.

By following the above guide and exploring each tab and feature in the UI, you can fully leverage the BRM Tool for large-scale, multi-team rule authoring and execution. It can also serve as a reference solution for advanced business rules management compared to typical commercial solutions, thanks to its open architecture, advanced lineage features, BFS-based skipping logic for critical rules, version rollbacks, and group-based security model.

Tips & Next Steps:
	1.	Deploy the DDL from scratch in an empty database.
	2.	Check the “8 parts” code carefully, ensuring any needed library (PyQt5, sqlparse, etc.) is installed.
	3.	Run the application, confirm you can log in with a user from the USERS table.
	4.	Verify each tab in the UI.
	5.	Enable deeper performance logging in BFS if desired (like capturing CPU usage or SQL execution times).
	6.	Enhance the lineage search to highlight columns or partial table names.
	7.	Consider adding foreign keys or indexes for better performance in production.

With these guidelines and the integrated code, you will have a robust, end-to-end Business Rules Management solution.
