Below is a detailed user guide describing every major tab and functional use case of the BRM Tool. In the examples provided, we assume the tool is used in a financial risk exposure context (for example, managing and monitoring credit risk, market risk, or operational risk rules). This guide explains how to use each feature and provides practical examples.

Business Rule Management (BRM) Tool – User Guide

The BRM Tool is a fully integrated application that supports the complete lifecycle of business rules. In a financial risk exposure environment, it can be used to validate, monitor, and approve rules that drive risk calculations and compliance controls. The tool supports the following functions:
	•	Rule Creation, Update, Deactivation, and Deletion
	•	Multi-step Approvals (with Approve/Reject functionality)
	•	Dry-run (Simulation) for individual rules, entire rule chains, and custom rule groups
	•	BFS-based rule execution with logging (for ETL and rule validation)
	•	Global/Critical Administration (to manage rules that affect risk exposure on a global scale)
	•	Hierarchy View and Enhanced Lineage Graph (to visualize rule dependencies)
	•	Custom Rule Groups (for grouping rules by risk type, product line, etc., with backup/restore)
	•	Scheduling of Rule Execution
	•	Control Tables viewer, Audit Log viewer, and Rule Search
	•	Metrics Dashboard and Advanced features (including decision tables, conflict priority, composite rules, rule chaining, snapshots, tagging, and data validation)

Below, you will find step‐by‐step instructions for every tab and use case.

1. Getting Started

Database Connection and Login
	•	At Startup:
When you run the tool, you are prompted with a Database Connection dialog.
• Use Case Example:
In a risk management department, a risk analyst might select a preconfigured ODBC DSN that points to the enterprise SQL Server containing risk rules and audit data.
	•	Login:
After a successful connection, you see the Login dialog. Enter your username and password.
• Example:
A credit risk manager logs in with credentials provided by IT to access the rule management system.

2. Business Rule Management Tab

This tab is the central area for managing business rules that define risk exposure parameters.

Features:
	•	Add New Rule:
Click Add Rule to open the rule editor dialog. Fill in details such as rule name, SQL logic, effective dates, owner group, and any advanced properties (e.g., global flag or critical indicator).
• Example:
A new credit risk rule might check that the ratio of non-performing loans does not exceed 5%. The SQL may query a credit portfolio table, and the tool will automatically extract table dependencies.
	•	Update Rule:
Select a rule from the dashboard and click Update Rule to modify its SQL, description, or other attributes. A new version is created, and a re-approval process is initiated (unless the rule is global).
	•	Deactivate Rule:
Before deletion, a rule must be deactivated. Click Deactivate Selected to mark a rule as inactive.
• Example:
A market risk rule that is no longer valid is deactivated so that it is no longer used in production.
	•	Delete Rule:
Once a rule is deactivated and has no dependent child rules or column mappings, it can be deleted.
	•	Run ETL (Execute Rules):
Click Run ETL to execute rules in a BFS order. This process runs rules sequentially, skipping child rules if a critical rule fails.
	•	Simulation:
Click Simulate Rule to perform a dry-run of the rule’s SQL logic without affecting production data.
• Example:
Simulate a credit risk rule to see if it returns the expected “PASS” or “FAIL” value before full deployment.
	•	Impact Analysis:
Click Impact Analysis to view a list of descendant rules that would be affected by changes in a selected rule.
	•	Version History:
Click Version History to view the audit log for changes to a rule and optionally roll back to an earlier version.

Use Case Example:

A financial risk team creates a new rule for credit risk exposure:
• Rule Name: “Max Credit Exposure Limit”
• SQL: A query that returns 1 if total exposure is less than a specified threshold (e.g., $100M) and 0 otherwise.
• Effective Dates: Set to the current month
• Owner Group: “CreditRisk”
After saving, the tool extracts dependencies (e.g., the “Credit_Portfolio” table), logs the rule, and sends email notifications to relevant groups. The rule then enters an approval workflow.

3. Multi-Step Approvals Tab

This tab is for users who need to approve rules before they become active.

Features:
	•	Approval Table:
The tab lists all rules pending your approval. For each rule, you see the rule ID, name, current approval stage, and group.
	•	Approve Button:
Click Approve to mark the rule as approved for your group. The tool then advances the rule to the next stage.
	•	Reject Button:
Click Reject to mark the rule as rejected. This will cancel the approval process, and the rule status is set to “REJECTED.”
	•	Pipeline Indicator:
A visual pipeline shows the multi-step approval process (e.g., BG1, BG2, BG3, FINAL).

Use Case Example:

A risk manager in the “CreditRisk” group reviews a new rule. They see that the rule is pending at stage 1 (BG1). If they click Approve, the rule advances to the next stage (BG2). If they click Reject, the rule is halted, and the system logs the rejection.

4. Global/Critical Admin Tab

This tab is for Admin users to manage rules that are designated as global or critical.

Features:
	•	View Global/Critical Rules:
The tab displays rules that are marked as global or critical.
	•	Set Global/Critical Flags:
Admin users can change flags, update critical scope, and re-initiate approval workflows if necessary.
	•	Link/Unlink Child Rules:
You can link additional rules as “child” rules to a parent global/critical rule, ensuring that if the parent fails, its descendants are skipped.

Use Case Example:

A market risk rule that impacts several portfolios is marked as global. The admin uses this tab to set the global flag, update its critical scope to “GLOBAL,” and link additional related rules. This ensures that if the global rule fails, dependent rules do not execute, reducing systemic risk.

5. Custom Rule Groups Tab

This tab lets users create and manage custom groups of rules.

Features:
	•	Create Custom Group:
Enter a group name and create a new custom rule group (e.g., for a specific portfolio).
	•	Rename/Delete Custom Group:
Modify or remove groups as needed.
	•	Backup/Restore:
Backup the current custom group configuration and restore to a previous version if necessary.
	•	Assign Rules:
Select rules from the available list (excluding those already assigned) and assign them to the custom group.

Use Case Example:

A financial institution wants to analyze operational risk separately. The risk manager creates a custom group named “Operational Risk – Q1 2025,” then assigns selected operational risk rules to this group. The backup function allows them to capture a snapshot before making bulk changes.

6. Scheduling Tab

This tab allows users to schedule rule execution.

Features:
	•	Rule Scheduler Dialog:
Select a rule from a drop-down list and choose a future date/time when it should execute.
	•	Schedule Management:
View a table of scheduled rules, their execution times, and current statuses.

Use Case Example:

A risk analyst schedules a credit risk rule to execute daily at midnight so that daily exposures are recalculated automatically.

7. Metrics Dashboard Tab

This tab displays operational metrics using a visual chart (powered by pyqtgraph).

Features:
	•	Bar Chart:
Displays counts of rules by status (e.g., ACTIVE vs. INACTIVE) so that risk managers can quickly gauge system health.
	•	Refresh Metrics:
Click Refresh Metrics to update the chart.

Use Case Example:

The metrics dashboard shows that there are 150 active risk rules and 20 inactive ones. This gives managers an overview of system utilization and rule performance.

8. Decision Tables Tab

This tab is designed to manage decision tables that are used for rule simulation and validations.

Features:
	•	List Decision Tables:
View existing decision tables that might define risk thresholds or exposure limits.
	•	Add/Delete Decision Tables:
Create a new decision table or delete an obsolete one.

Use Case Example:

A risk analyst creates a decision table that defines credit exposure thresholds for different borrower segments. The table helps to dynamically adjust risk scores.

9. Conflict Priority Manager Tab

This tab is used to detect and resolve conflicts between rules.

Features:
	•	View Conflicts:
See a list of conflicting rules (e.g., two rules that have overlapping criteria for risk scoring).
	•	Set Priorities:
Update a rule’s priority to resolve conflicts.

Use Case Example:

If two risk rules conflict on credit exposure limits, the manager sets a higher priority on the rule that is more conservative, ensuring that in case of conflict the conservative rule takes precedence.

10. Composite Rules, Rule Chaining, Snapshots, Tags, and Data Validation Tabs

These advanced tabs provide additional functionality:
	•	Composite Rule Tab:
Combine multiple rules using logical operators (AND/OR) to create composite risk measures.
• Example: A composite rule calculates overall risk exposure by combining both market and credit risk rules.
	•	Rule Chaining Actions Tab:
Define actions that should be triggered when a rule passes or fails.
• Example: If a risk rule fails, trigger an alert email or a follow‐up simulation.
	•	Snapshot Manager Tab:
Take snapshots of rule versions to compare changes over time.
• Example: Compare current risk rules to a snapshot taken before a regulatory change.
	•	Rule Tags Manager Tab:
Assign tags to rules (e.g., “Credit,” “Market,” “Operational”) for easier filtering and reporting.
	•	Data Validation Tab:
Define validations on input data (for example, ranges for risk exposures) to ensure consistency.

These tabs help a financial institution manage complex risk scenarios by enabling composite scoring, change tracking, and granular validations.

11. Hierarchy View Tab

This tab displays the hierarchical relationships among rule groups and rules.

Features:
	•	Tree View:
See the structure of rule groups and the rules within them.

Use Case Example:

A risk manager can view all rules under the “CreditRisk” group and their parent–child relationships, which helps in understanding cascading impacts if a rule is modified.

12. Enhanced Lineage Graph Tab

This tab provides a visual, BFS-based lineage graph showing:
	•	Rule dependencies
	•	Table dependencies (extracted from SQL via sqlparse)

Features:
	•	Graph Visualization:
Nodes represent rules (and external tables), and edges represent dependencies.
	•	Search and Reset:
You can search for a rule or table; matching nodes are highlighted. Reset the view or refresh the graph as needed.

Use Case Example:

A market risk rule calculates Value at Risk (VaR) and depends on multiple underlying tables. The lineage graph shows the entire dependency chain, helping analysts verify the data flow and isolate potential issues.

13. Group Management Tab (Admin Only)

This tab is available only to Admin users.

Features:
	•	View and Manage Business Groups:
List all business groups from the BUSINESS_GROUPS table.
	•	Add/Rename/Delete Groups:
Admins can create new groups, rename existing groups, or delete groups.
	•	Backup/Restore Groups:
Create backups of a group’s configuration and restore them if needed.

Use Case Example:

A risk management team is restructured; an admin uses this tab to rename a group from “RiskDept” to “EnterpriseRisk” and later restores a backup if an error occurs.

14. User Management Tab (Admin Only)

This tab is available only to Admin users for managing users.

Features:
	•	List Users:
View all users in the system.
	•	Add New User:
Create new user accounts (for risk analysts, managers, etc.).
	•	Delete User / Reset Password:
Manage user accounts as needed.

Use Case Example:

An admin adds a new user for a risk analyst in the credit risk team. They later reset the password for an employee who forgot theirs.

15. Control Tables Tab

This tab allows users to view the contents of various control tables.

Features:
	•	Table List:
A drop-down list of all control tables (e.g., USERS, BUSINESS_GROUPS, BRM_RULES, etc.).
	•	Data Viewer:
When you select a table and click “Load Data,” the tool runs a SELECT * on that table and displays the results.

Use Case Example:

A risk manager can review the audit log or the business groups table to verify data integrity.

16. Additional Use Cases in Financial Risk Exposure

Example 1: Credit Risk Rule Creation and Approval
	1.	Add Rule:
– The risk team creates a rule “Max Credit Exposure Limit” with SQL that validates that the total credit exposure for a customer is below $100M.
– The system extracts the “Credit_Portfolio” table dependency and sends email notifications to the “CreditRisk” group.
	2.	Approval:
– The rule appears in the Multi-step Approvals tab. A user in BG1 reviews and approves it, which advances it to BG2.
	3.	Simulation:
– The rule is simulated (dry-run) to ensure that if the exposure exceeds $100M, the rule returns a “FAIL” signal.
	4.	Deployment:
– Once fully approved, the rule is activated and becomes part of the risk exposure calculations.
	5.	Audit & Metrics:
– The Audit Log viewer shows the version history and changes.
– The Metrics Dashboard displays that there are now X active rules affecting credit risk.

Example 2: Market Risk – Global Rule and Lineage Visualization
	1.	Global Rule Creation:
– A global rule is defined to calculate Value at Risk (VaR) across multiple trading desks. Because of its significance, it’s flagged as global and critical.
	2.	Global/Critical Admin:
– The admin uses the Global/Critical Admin tab to ensure that if this rule fails, all downstream rules are skipped.
	3.	Lineage Visualization:
– The Enhanced Lineage Graph displays the dependencies from the VaR rule to the underlying trade data tables.
– Searching for “VaR” highlights the rule and its dependent tables.
	4.	Simulation & Audit:
– A dry-run simulation is performed to confirm the rule behaves as expected before production deployment.
– The audit log confirms the changes.

Example 3: Operational Risk – Custom Rule Groups and Scheduling
	1.	Custom Rule Group Creation:
– A custom group called “Operational Risk – Q1 2025” is created and several operational risk rules are assigned.
	2.	Backup & Restore:
– Before making major changes, the group is backed up. If a mistake is made, the backup can be restored.
	3.	Scheduling:
– A rule in this group is scheduled to run at the beginning of each month to capture operational risk metrics.
	4.	Control Tables & Metrics:
– The Control Tables tab is used to verify that the scheduling data is correct, and the Metrics Dashboard shows a summary of scheduled rules.
