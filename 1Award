Got it ✅ — I’ll refine the nomination to emphasize that BRM is fully in-house, incurs no third-party licensing cost, and includes training for business users. I’ll also highlight the approval hierarchy (multi-step governance) and impacted teams. Here’s the updated nomination draft:

4. Initiative / Contribution Description

The BRM (Business Rules Management) Tool is a fully in-house, no-cost no-code/low-code solution that empowers business users to independently manage data movement, transformation, and quality checks. It eliminates reliance on expensive third-party tools and IT resources, while embedding automated metadata and data lineage capture for every rule created, modified, or deleted.

The team also led training programs for business SMEs, enabling them to adopt the tool confidently and maximize self-service transformation capabilities.
