Below is a PowerPoint-style outline plus a demo approach for showcasing every feature of your BRM Tool (Parts 1–8). You can copy these slides into an actual .pptx or any presentation software. The outline provides slide titles, core bullet points, and a demo flow walking the audience through your tool’s entire functionality.

Slide 3 – High-Level Architecture

Key Points:
	•	Show a diagram of:
	1.	Database (tables from your DDL).
	2.	BRM Tool code modules (Parts 1–8).
	3.	BFS engine, scheduling engine, multi-step approvals layer, UI layers (lineage, dashboards).
	•	Emphasize modular approach: “One codebase, multiple integrated parts.”

Slide 4 – Part 1: Connection & Login

Key Points:
	•	DatabaseConnectionDialog for ODBC DSN or custom string.
	•	LoginDialog: verifies username/password from USERS table.
	•	Outline user flows:
	•	The user picks DSN or enters a custom connection → hits “Connect.”
	•	Then sees the Login screen, enters credentials → becomes an authenticated user.

Slide 5 – Part 2: BFS & Multi-Level Approvals

Key Points:
	•	BFS logic to execute rules in dependency order, skipping if a parent fails.
	•	Multi-step approvals: each rule can have multiple group approvals. Show the “Approvals” tab.
	•	Demo “locking a rule,” “approving,” “rejecting,” or forced unlock by admin.

Slide 6 – Part 3: Scheduling & Simulation

Key Points:
	•	Scheduling: EnhancedScheduleDialog & ScheduleManagementTab.
	•	Chain/Group Simulation: BFS for a single parent rule, or all rules in a custom group.
	•	Show “Simulate BFS” dialogs → pass/fail if rule returns 1 or 0.

Slide 7 – Part 4: Advanced UI

Key Points:
	•	Audit Log Viewer: search/filter, CSV export.
	•	Rule Search: find rules by snippet, name, or SQL.
	•	Version History & Diff: line-by-line old/new data.
	•	Rule Dashboard: a table or “cards” display with status filters, pagination.

Slide 8 – Part 5: Global/Critical Admin & Enhanced Lineage

Key Points:
	•	GCR Admin Tab: set global/critical flags, forced activation/deactivation, link child rules, etc.
	•	Hierarchy View: Drag-and-drop re-parenting in a tree (group → rule).
	•	Enhanced Lineage: a robust QGraphicsView with BFS neighbor highlighting, multi-field search (db/table/column/rule/group), synonyms/fuzzy matching, color-coded shapes, and a sub-tab for raw table-based lineage data.

Slide 9 – Part 6: Metrics, Control Tables, Group & User Mgmt

Key Points:
	•	MetricsDashboardTab: rule counts by status, execution trends, data validation ratio, etc.
	•	ControlTablesTab: read/write reference tables (like BUSINESS_GROUPS, DECISION_TABLES, etc.).
	•	GroupManagementTab: manage business groups, membership, approvers, permissions.
	•	UserManagementTab: add/delete user, change password, encrypted or hashed approach.

Slide 10 – Part 7: Custom Rule Groups & Alerts

Key Points:
	•	Custom Groups: create, rename, delete. Assign or remove rules, backup/restore group membership. Forced lock checks if rule is locked.
	•	Alerts & Dashboards: old approvals, upcoming schedules, performance outliers, stale locks, etc.

Slide 11 – Part 8: Final Aggregation

Key Points:
	•	The aggregator QMainWindow merges all tabs & functionality:
	•	BFS logic, multi-level approvals, scheduling, advanced lineage, metrics, custom groups, etc.
	•	Summarize “best in class” approach.
	•	Show impersonation if user is Admin.
	•	Conclude with emphasis on synergy among modules.

Slide 12 – Demo Flow

Key Points:
	•	We’ll walk step-by-step:
	1.	Login as “BG1User.”
	2.	Explore Rule Dashboard → add a new rule, show BFS logic.
	3.	Switch to Approvals tab → see pending approvals, do Approve or Reject.
	4.	Go to Scheduling → schedule a rule. Show upcoming schedules.
	5.	Check Lineage → demonstrate advanced search for “customer,” watch fuzzy synonyms highlight “client,” see BFS neighbor highlights, color-coded rules vs. tables. Then switch sub-tab to “Tabular.”
	6.	Metrics → show bar chart for status, line chart for performance.
	7.	Custom Groups → create group “FinanceRules,” assign a few rules, remove locked rule, forcibly unlock if admin.
	8.	Alerts → shows old approvals, upcoming schedules, performance alerts.
	9.	Impersonate Admin user → forced unlock or GCR admin.
	10.	Wrap up with Audit Logs → search “INSERT.” Export CSV.

Slide 13 – Q&A / Conclusion

Key Points:
	•	“Any questions about BFS logic, multi-level approvals, or advanced lineage searches?”
	•	Potential next steps: “We can add more data validations, or pipeline orchestration.”

2. Demo Approach (Step by Step)

Below is a recommended live demonstration sequence for your entire tool. This approach aligns with the slides:
	1.	Launch the BRM Tool
	•	Start the application. The Database Connection Dialog appears.
	•	Enter a valid DSN or custom string → click “Connect.”
	•	Show how connection success leads to the Login screen.
	2.	Login
	•	Enter “BG1User” and correct password.
	•	The main window (Part 8 aggregator) loads with tabs: Business Rules, Approvals, Scheduling, etc.
	3.	Basic BFS & Approvals
	•	Navigate to Business Rules (the “RuleDashboardTab” or similar).
	•	Add a new rule named “ApproveInvoice.” Show how it sets status=INACTIVE, triggers multi-level approvals.
	•	Switch to Approvals tab. See the new rule at Stage 1. Approve it → show how it becomes “Approved” → “ACTIVE.”
	4.	Scheduling
	•	Go to the Scheduling tab. Add a new schedule for “ApproveInvoice” at some future time.
	•	Show it in the list of RULE_SCHEDULES.
	5.	Defect Management (If you have that tab in Part 4 or Part 8)
	•	Add a new defect related to “ApproveInvoice.” Mark severity “High.”
	•	Show how it’s stored in BRM_DEFECT_LOGS.
	6.	Lineage
	•	Open the advanced lineage tab. Show the force-directed graph with color-coded nodes:
	•	Tables in yellow ellipse, rules in blue ellipse, critical rules with red dashed border, etc.
	•	In the Search fields, type “customer” for “Rule Name” or “Table.” If synonyms or fuzzy logic is enabled for “client,” show how it highlights “Customers.”
	•	Check “Highlight Neighbors?” so the entire chain from “Customers” to any rule remains visible.
	•	Switch to Tabular sub-tab. Show raw data (NodeID, Type, DB, Table, Column, etc.).
	7.	Group & User Mgmt
	•	If you’re an Admin, show how to add a new user “TestUser,” or reassign them to “BG2.”
	•	Show Group Management → add a new group “FinanceTeam.”
	8.	Custom Rule Groups & Alerts
	•	In the Custom Groups tab, create a group “FinanceRules,” add “ApproveInvoice” rule.
	•	Show how removing a locked rule fails unless you’re Admin → forcibly unlock.
	•	In the Alerts tab, see if “old approvals” or “performance alerts” appear.
	9.	Metrics
	•	Check “Rule Counts by Status,” “Execution Trends,” etc. in the Metrics Dashboard.
	10.	Audit Log

	•	Finally, open AuditLogViewer (from the menu). Filter by “INSERT” or “UPDATE.” Show CSV export.

	11.	Wrap Up

	•	Possibly impersonate Admin to do “Global/Critical Admin,” forced activation, GCR link to child rules, etc.

End the demonstration by summarizing how all the features integrate seamlessly.

3. Final Notes
	•	This PPT outline + stepwise demo ensures you systematically cover each Part (1–8).
	•	Emphasize your unique selling points: BFS-based logic, multi-level approvals, advanced scheduling, “best in class” lineage with fuzzy synonyms, force-directed layout, color-coded nodes, robust tabular & graphical display, real-time metrics & alerts.
	•	Feel free to tailor the slides for your environment, using screenshots.
	•	If you have sample data or a small “demo DB,” show real BFS execution results (like a rule returning 1 => pass, or 0 => fail).

By following these slides and demo steps, you’ll provide a comprehensive feature demonstration—highlighting the advanced UI/UX, BFS/approvals logic, robust lineage searching, and more. Good luck with your presentation!
