11. Sample Vision Statement for Slide/Exec Summary

“Our GenAI Center of Excellence will transform Credit Risk, combining data, automation, and human expertise to deliver faster, smarter, and more compliant decisions—setting the standard for the future of risk management.”


Perfect scenario—and a smart move! A GenAI Center of Excellence (CoE) in Credit Risk can set your org ahead of the curve, especially if you establish the right operational model from the start.

Here’s how a world-class AIML leader would approach your setup:

⸻

1. Clear Team Structure & Role Assignment

With 4 tech leads (assuming strong individual contributors, not pure managers), you need roles that balance both vertical expertise and horizontal collaboration.

Sample Roles for Tech Leads (adapt based on strengths):
	1.	GenAI Solutions Architect
	•	Designs overall GenAI system, ensures security & compliance (crucial in credit risk).
	•	Responsible for technical stack decisions, LLM integration, and scalability.
	2.	Data & ML Pipeline Lead
	•	Owns end-to-end data ingestion, cleansing, labeling, and ML model lifecycle.
	•	Champions reproducibility, lineage, and automated retraining (model ops).
	3.	Prompt Engineering & GenAI Applications Lead
	•	Specializes in prompt design, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and business use-case mapping.
	•	Creates prototypes, PoCs, and interfaces for users/business.
	4.	Platform & DevOps Lead
	•	Handles deployment, CI/CD, monitoring, and cloud costs.
	•	Ensures models and apps are production-grade, robust, and observable.

Bonus: Assign one person as “Kanban Process Champion” (rotationally), responsible for board hygiene, ceremonies, and removing blockers.

⸻

2. Team Operating & Engagement Model

Operating Model Principles:
	•	Kanban: Visualize work, limit WIP, focus on flow.
	•	Weekly Standups & Kanban Reviews: Track progress, re-prioritize, demo quick wins.
	•	Monthly Stakeholder Sync: Demo value, get business feedback, align on pipeline.

Engagement:
	•	Direct line to business/product (you), plus regular touchpoints with Credit Risk SMEs.
	•	Encourage pair programming & “show-and-tell” for fast knowledge transfer.
	•	Pilot phase: 60% build, 40% research/enablement (this ratio can shift post-pilot).

⸻

3. Backlog Structure – Foundation Stories

Even if the use case is “TBD,” you need foundation stories so the team isn’t idle:

Sample Foundational Stories:
	1.	Environment Setup
	•	Spin up secure, compliant GenAI dev/test/prod environments (Azure/AWS/GCP).
	2.	Data Source Audit
	•	Inventory internal/external data for credit risk use cases (FR2590, KYC, transaction data, etc.).
	3.	Build & Evaluate Baseline LLM
	•	Choose LLM (Azure OpenAI, AWS Bedrock, etc.), test against credit risk Q&A.
	4.	Prompt Library Kickoff
	•	Create a versioned repo for prompts, templates for internal/external Q&A.
	5.	RAG Pipeline Prototype
	•	POC for ingesting policies or regulatory docs, enabling Q&A via LLM + vector search.
	6.	Security & Compliance Assessment
	•	Story for threat modeling, PII handling, model explainability (regulatory need).
	7.	Model Monitoring MVP
	•	Build out basic model usage/response monitoring.
	8.	Kanban Tooling Customization
	•	Tune Jira/Confluence/DevOps boards for GenAI specifics.

4. Sample Pilot Backlog (First Sprint)

Story	Owner	Priority
Setup secure dev environment	Platform Lead	High
Audit credit risk data sources	Data/ML Lead	High
Integrate baseline LLM	Architect	High
Design initial prompt templates	Prompt Eng Lead	Med
Define model monitoring plan	Platform Lead	Med
Kickoff Kanban rituals	Kanban Champion	High
Document everything in Confluence	All	Ongoing


⸻

5. Key Metrics for Pilot Success
	•	Working LLM-powered Q&A against at least one real credit risk doc/data source
	•	Compliance signoff for environment and data handling
	•	Playbook for prompt engineering and model monitoring
	•	Stakeholder demo that gets business “aha!” moment

⸻

6. Leadership Tips
	•	Over-communicate early value—business needs to see traction.
	•	Make the board visible (show velocity, blockers, WIP).
	•	Celebrate fast feedback, even if it’s “we learned this won’t work.”

⸻

7. Confluence/Kanban Board Structure (see previous answer for Confluence hierarchy)
