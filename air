As AI/ML adoption expands across upstream systems, we are entering a phase where AI-driven logic may directly or indirectly influence regulatory reporting outputs (FR2590, Y-9C, GL reconciliation, liquidity metrics).
At present, we do not have a centralized AI risk portfolio or a traceability mechanism capable of answering the following within hours:
* Where AI has influenced regulatory data
* What model/version was active
* What changed and when
* Which downstream reports and balances were impacted
This creates increasing exposure under SR 11-7, BCBS 239, and financial reporting controls.
I propose establishing a lightweight but scalable Enterprise AI Traceability & Regulatory Impact Frameworkembedded within existing data pipelines.
The framework would introduce:
1. AI Usage Registry – Mandatory declaration of AI models influencing enterprise data
2. Attribute-Level Checkpoints – Fingerprint-based traceability across landing, canonical, and regulatory mart layers
3. Downstream Impact Mapping – Attribute → Report Line → GL Control dependency mapping
4. Tamper-Evident Event Ledger – Append-only trace history for audit defensibility
This is not a system rebuild. It leverages our existing Azure and data infrastructure and can be phased over 3–6 months.
Outcome:
* Rapid root-cause isolation
* Regulatory defensibility
* Controlled AI scaling
* Reduced reconciliation cycle time
I recommend we formalize this as an enterprise standard before AI influence becomes material in regulatory reporting.
