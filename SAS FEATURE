Absolutely! Here’s a comprehensive mapping of key features to user stories, providing a clear path from now to project completion for your SAS Redundancy PoC. Each feature is broken into actionable stories, with built-in success criteria, to move systematically from raw SAS code to final business impact and reporting.

SAS Redundancy PoC: Features, Stories, and Completion Path

⸻

Feature 1: SAS File Inventory

Stories
	•	1.1 Inventory Script
	•	As a Data Engineer, I want to script and run a recursive scan of all project directories to list SAS files with metadata (name, path, size, last modified), so that we have a clear project scope.
	•	Success: All SAS files listed in a CSV/DF, validated by the team.
	•	1.2 Automated Updates
	•	As a Data Engineer, I want to re-run the inventory script weekly or as needed to capture new/changed files.
	•	Success: Inventory reflects the latest files and any new SAS added.

⸻

Feature 2: File Chunking and Preprocessing

Stories
	•	2.1 Chunking Function
	•	As a Data Engineer, I want to build a Python function to segment large SAS files into logical code blocks (data steps/macros), so that GenAI can analyze smaller units effectively.
	•	Success: At least 10 files chunked and reviewed; function reusable for all files.
	•	2.2 Storage Structure
	•	As a Data Engineer, I want to organize all raw files, code chunks, and outputs in a versioned, well-structured repository for traceability and easy access.
	•	Success: Directory structure agreed and documented; all outputs stored with clear naming/versioning.

⸻

Feature 3: GenAI-Driven Metadata Extraction

Stories
	•	3.1 Prompt Engineering
	•	As an AI/ML Engineer, I want to develop, test, and iterate GenAI prompts to extract data sources, tables, columns, and logic from SAS code, so that we can automate metadata discovery.
	•	Success: Prompts tested on at least 5 chunks, output meets analyst expectations.
	•	3.2 Batch Processing Script
	•	As an AI/ML Engineer, I want to automate sending code chunks to GenAI via API, collecting structured outputs, and logging results for review.
	•	Success: Script processes at least 10 files, outputs saved for further analysis.
	•	3.3 Prompt Versioning and Documentation
	•	As an AI/ML Engineer, I want to document prompt changes and results, so the team can learn and reuse best-performing prompts.
	•	Success: Prompt “playbook” maintained in repo/wiki.

⸻

Feature 4: RDS Metadata Catalog and Preparation

Stories
	•	4.1 RDS Metadata Extraction
	•	As a Business/Data Analyst, I want to collect and catalog all relevant RDS tables, schemas, and columns for comparison with SAS logic.
	•	Success: Metadata available as DataFrame/Excel, validated for completeness.
	•	4.2 Business Logic Documentation
	•	As a Business/Data Analyst, I want to document business context and lineage for key data entities, so we can judge redundancy accurately.
	•	Success: Annotated metadata file, with business notes where available.

⸻

Feature 5: Reconciliation and Redundancy Tagging

Stories
	•	5.1 Automated Entity Matching
	•	As a Business/Data Analyst, I want to compare GenAI-extracted entities to RDS catalog using a script, so that I can identify full, partial, or unique overlaps.
	•	Success: At least 10 files tagged (Redundant/Partial/Unique), process repeatable.
	•	5.2 Manual Review and Exception Handling
	•	As a Business/Data Analyst, I want to manually review ambiguous cases or errors flagged by GenAI, documenting findings for future automation.
	•	Success: Edge cases recorded, with resolution steps noted.

⸻

Feature 6: Redundancy Analysis and Visualization

Stories
	•	6.1 Summary Table
	•	As a Business/Data Analyst, I want to aggregate and summarize redundancy status for all files, showing counts/% for each category.
	•	Success: Up-to-date summary table produced and validated.
	•	6.2 Visualization
	•	As a Data Engineer or Analyst, I want to create charts (pie, bar, etc.) showing the breakdown of redundant, partial, and unique files for stakeholder demos.
	•	Success: Visual(s) reviewed in demo; feedback captured.

⸻

Feature 7: Reporting, Demo, and Documentation

Stories
	•	7.1 Demo Notebook/Slide Deck
	•	As a Product Owner, I want to prepare a demo with before/after examples, process summary, and key visuals for business/IT stakeholders.
	•	Success: Demo delivered to stakeholders; feedback captured.
	•	7.2 Final PoC Report
	•	As a Product Owner, I want to compile all findings, code, visuals, and lessons learned in a final report and team knowledge base.
	•	Success: Report shared, approved by project sponsors.
	•	7.3 Team Retrospective & Close-out
	•	As a Scrum Master/PO, I want to run a final retrospective and update the Foundation epic with key skills acquired, blockers, and future recommendations.
	•	Success: Retro notes documented; Foundation epic closed.

⸻

Clear Project Completion Path (Checklist)
	1.	SAS file inventory and chunking complete, all files ready for analysis
	2.	GenAI prompts tested and batch extraction script run for all code chunks
	3.	RDS metadata collected, catalogued, and validated
	4.	Entity reconciliation/tagging script run on all outputs; ambiguous cases resolved
	5.	Redundancy analysis summary and business impact visualized
	6.	Demo delivered to business/IT, feedback incorporated
	7.	Final report and knowledge base completed; project retrospective held

⸻

Kanban Guidance
	•	Each story = one Kanban card; each feature = one Kanban label/epic.
	•	Move cards only when success criteria met—ensures steady, validated progress.
	•	Review/Done columns for demos, retro, and documentation.
