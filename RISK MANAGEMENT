This is a great, forward-looking question! Here’s a practical guide for your newly formed AI pilot team on compliance, AI risk management, and model validation—plus clear accountability pointers (including business and tech leadership roles).
This is designed for a regulated or risk-aware environment and works for both early PoCs and enterprise pilots.

Compliance & Risk Handling for AI Pilot

1. Compliance & Risk Management Structure

a) Define Roles and Accountability
	•	Product Owner / Project Sponsor:
Ensures the pilot’s goals align with business objectives and compliance expectations; escalates unresolved risks.
	•	Business SME/Owner:
Provides data context, clarifies business rules, validates real-world outcomes, and approves acceptable risk boundaries.
	•	Tech Leadership / AI Lead / MLOps Lead:
Accountable for model design, technical risk controls, documentation, and validation process; ensures responsible use of AI.
	•	Compliance/Risk Officer (if available):
Advises on regulatory requirements, privacy, and risk policy alignment.

2. AI Risk Management Steps
	•	Data Risk Assessment:
Identify PII/sensitive data, ensure data minimization, masking, and proper access controls from the start.
	•	Model Risk Assessment:
Document intended use, known limitations, and potential misuse/misalignment of models or GenAI (e.g., hallucinations, bias).
	•	Validation Plan:
Set clear criteria for model or GenAI prompt validation (accuracy, consistency, auditability).
	•	Approval Gates:
Define “go/no-go” points where business and tech leads jointly review and approve outcomes before advancing to next pilot phase.

3. Model Validation (For All AI Outputs)
	•	Establish baseline metrics:
What is “good enough” (precision, recall, business impact, explainability)?
	•	Validation workflow:
	•	Tech team runs initial validation (unit tests, sample outputs, edge case review).
	•	Business owner reviews results for real-world acceptability.
	•	Joint review documented in a “Validation Log.”
	•	Documentation:
Maintain versioned documentation of models, prompts, validation data, and results (audit trail).

⸻

4. Ongoing Monitoring and Change Control
	•	Monitor outputs for errors, drift, or unintended consequences.
	•	Log and triage incidents (with clear escalation paths).
	•	Change management:
Any changes to model logic, prompts, or process go through review with business and tech sign-off.

5. Who is Accountable?

Area	Accountable Role(s)
AI/Data Compliance	Product Owner, Compliance Officer, Business SME
Model Risk Management	Tech Lead, MLOps Lead, AI Architect, Business Owner
Model Validation	Tech Lead (run/record), Business SME (approve)
Ongoing Monitoring	Tech Lead, MLOps, with escalation to leadership as needed

	•	Final accountability rests with the cross-functional Leadership Team, who must approve pilot go-live and any scaling beyond PoC.
	•	Documentation and sign-off should always be in place (a simple shared Validation Log in Confluence, Excel, or approved tool works for pilots).

Practical Steps for Your Pilot
	1.	Kickoff: Assign clear roles for compliance, model validation, and risk review.
	2.	Draft a “Validation & Risk Register”—list all checkpoints, sign-off owners, and escalation contacts.
	3.	Hold a regular “AI Risk Check-In” (15 minutes each sprint) to log new risks, blockers, or policy questions.
	4.	Keep all validation artifacts versioned and accessible for audit/review.

Quick Example (For Your Pilot Confluence or Kickoff Doc):

Accountabilities:
	•	Product Owner: Ensures pilot aligns to business/compliance goals; escalates unresolved risks.
	•	Business Owner/SME: Approves data sources, reviews outputs for business fit, signs off on acceptable risk.
	•	Tech Lead / MLOps: Designs model/prompt controls, runs validation, documents, and maintains technical risk register.
	•	Compliance (if available): Reviews process for privacy, fairness, and policy alignment.

All model validations require sign-off from both Business and Tech leads before pilot progression.
